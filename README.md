## üìñ About

This project is a **GymPass-like API** developed during the **Node.js course from Rocketseat**. It's a REST API that implements a gym check-in system with authentication, geolocation validation, and business rules enforcement, following **SOLID principles** and **Clean Architecture**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd 03-api-solid
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
